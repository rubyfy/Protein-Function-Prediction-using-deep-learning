look at the changes i made and tell me if i should change anything : # 🧬 Protein Function Prediction using Deep Learning

This project explores multiple deep learning architectures and parameter configurations to predict protein functions from proteomic data, in addition to implementing multiple ways to handle highly imbalanced data.  
It was developed as part of my master’s thesis in **Image and Information Engineering** at **Ferhat Abbas University**.


## 📘 Overview
The main goal of this work is to evaluate how different deep learning models and hyperparameter choices affect the accuracy of protein function prediction.  
The models were trained and tested on proteomic datasets, proteins sequences to be precise, using various preprocessing, feature extraction and data balancing techniques.
